      <description>Team#Bootstrap is maintained by a small team of developers on GitHub. We&amp;rsquo;re actively looking to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you&amp;rsquo;re excited about CSS at scale, writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript plugins, and improving build tooling processes for frontend code.
History#Originally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.</description>

      <description>Have a need for Bootstrap&amp;rsquo;s brand resources? Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well.
Logo#When referencing Bootstrap, use our logo mark. Do not modify our logos in any way. Do not use Bootstrap&amp;rsquo;s branding for your own open or closed source projects.</description>
