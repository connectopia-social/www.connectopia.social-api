We\u0026rsquo;re actively looking to grow this team and would love to hear from you if you\u0026rsquo;re excited about CSS at scale, writing and maintaining vanilla JavaScript plugins, and improving build tooling processes for frontend code.\nHistory\r#\rOriginally created by a designer and a developer at Twitter, Bootstrap has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source projects in the world.\nBootstrap was created at Twitter in mid-2010 by @mdo and @fat. Prior to being an open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. A few months into development, Twitter held its first Hack Week and the project exploded as developers of all skill levels jumped in without any external guidance. It served as the style guide for internal tools development at the company for over a year before its public release, and continues to do so today.\nOriginally released on Friday, August 19, 2011, we\u0026rsquo;ve since had over twenty releases, including two major rewrites with v2 and v3. With Bootstrap 2, we added responsive functionality to the entire framework as an optional stylesheet. Building on that with Bootstrap 3, we rewrote the library once more to make it responsive by default with a mobile first approach.\nWith Bootstrap 4, we once again rewrote the project to account for two key architectural changes: a migration to Sass and the move to CSS\u0026rsquo;s flexbox. Our intention is to help in a small way to move the web development community forward by pushing for newer CSS properties, fewer dependencies, and new technologies across more modern browsers.\nOur latest release, Bootstrap 5, focuses on improving v4\u0026rsquo;s codebase with as few major breaking changes as possible. We improved existing features and components, removed support for older browsers, dropped jQuery for regular JavaScript, and embraced more future-friendly technologies like CSS custom properties as part of our tooling.\nGet involved\r#\rGet involved with Bootstrap development by opening an issue or submitting a pull request.

Great! We have only a few guidelines we follow, and in turn ask you to follow as well.\nLogo\r#\rWhen referencing Bootstrap, use our logo mark. Do not modify our logos in any way. Do not use Bootstrap\u0026rsquo;s branding for your own open or closed source projects.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/docs/docs/getting-started/browsers-devices/","title":"Browsers and devices","section":"Getting Started","content":"\rSupported browsers\r#\rBootstrap supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms.\nAlternative browsers which use the latest version of WebKit, Blink, or Gecko, whether directly or via the platform\u0026rsquo;s web view API, are not explicitly supported. However, Bootstrap should (in most cases) display and function correctly in these browsers as well. More specific support information is provided below.\nYou can find our supported range of browsers and their versions in our .browserslistrc file:\nWe use Autoprefixer to handle intended browser support via CSS prefixes, which uses Browserslist to manage these browser versions. Consult their documentation for how to integrate these tools into your projects.\nMobile devices\r#\rGenerally speaking, Bootstrap supports the latest versions of each major platform\u0026rsquo;s default browsers. Note that proxy browsers (such as Opera Mini, Opera Mobile\u0026rsquo;s Turbo mode, UC Browser Mini, Amazon Silk) are not supported.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/docs/docs/getting-started/download/","title":"Download","section":"Getting Started","content":"\rCompiled CSS and JS\r#\rDownload ready-to-use compiled code for Bootstrap v to easily drop into your project, which includes:\nCompiled and minified CSS bundles (see CSS files comparison) Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins (see JS files comparison) This doesn\u0026rsquo;t include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies like Popper.\nDownload\nSource files\r#\rCompile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files.
